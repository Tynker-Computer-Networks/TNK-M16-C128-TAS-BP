1. Run the flask app

2. Perform the Cross Site Scripting Attack by entering following lines in the feedback box:
     <script>alert('Hello! You are Hacked')</script>
     Also explain that sometimes script tags are blocked so it can also be done using where we are 
     accessing cookies that stores information such as user credentials and session info
     <img src onerror="alert('Hello! You are Hacked')">

3. You will get the alert on the feedback screen
4. Open the site link in incognito mode and again fill another feedback.
5. Observe that the script we injected effects others windows also so anyone opening the website will be effected by the attack
