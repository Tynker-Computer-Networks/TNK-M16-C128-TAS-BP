1. Run Flask feedback app
2. Run hacker dashboard app.

3. Code in the flask app.py tp check for user input
   a. use jinja to add show the data
   b. if using ajax then make sure user data is shown as text and not as inner html
   
4. See if the website's vulnerability is fixed.


Protecting against JavaScript injection (also known as Cross-Site Scripting or XSS) is crucial for web security. Here are various methods to prevent JavaScript injection:

Input Validation:
Validate and sanitize user input on both the client and server sides.
Use server-side validation to reject any input that doesn't meet expected criteria.

Output Encoding:
Encode user-generated content before rendering it in HTML. Use proper encoding functions such as htmlspecialchars() in PHP or similar in other languages.

Content Security Policy (CSP):
Implement a Content Security Policy header to restrict the types of content that can be loaded on a page.
Define a policy that prevents the execution of inline scripts and limits the domains from which scripts can be loaded.

Use HTTP Only and Secure Flags for Cookies:
Set the HTTP Only flag on cookies to prevent them from being accessed through JavaScript.
Use the Secure flag to ensure that cookies are only sent over HTTPS connections.

Escape User Input in Templates:
When rendering dynamic content in templates, make sure to escape variables to prevent them from being interpreted as code.

Use Frameworks with Built-in Security Features:
Choose web development frameworks that have built-in security features to help prevent common vulnerabilities, including XSS.

Regular Security Audits:
Regularly perform security audits of your web application's codebase to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.

Update Libraries and Dependencies:
Keep all libraries and dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches and fixes.

Parameterized Statements for Database Queries:
Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection attacks, which can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

User Authentication and Authorization:
Implement strong user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that users have the necessary permissions to perform actions.

Educate Developers and Users:
Train developers to write secure code and educate users about the risks of clicking on untrusted links or entering sensitive information on unfamiliar websites.

Browser Security Headers:
Implement security headers, such as X-Content-Type-Options and X-Frame-Options, to enhance the security posture of your web application.
